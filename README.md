# Random Number Generator For Improving Number Listening Skills

You can watch a lot of TV shows with english subtitles. Come here [http://video-with-subtitles.herokuapp.com](http://video-with-subtitles.herokuapp.com).

## Motivation

I'm a real TV-show freak, but unfortunately I'm not so good at English as I could watch TV shows or movies without subtitles (for the record, I hate a dubbed style). So I made up this website, combining the two great websites, [Springfield! Springfield!](http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk) and [Tvonline](http://www.tvonline.tw). 

## How it works

TODO: I will give some pictures or videos to show how it could be used. I should mension the collaboration with [WordCollector](http://github.com/hi-ogawa/wordCollector).

## How it is implemented

TODO: write this part one day.

## Futue functions or fixes

- Adopt to watching a movie from [Movie25](http://movie25.ag).
- Obviously, it doesn't make sense at all to use Ruby on Rails (and make it run on Heroku) since this websites totally works on javascript. So, I'm gonna replace Ruby on Rails and Heroku by some other easy framework and deployment service, or add some Ruby on Rails specific features.
- Keep what TV shows are watched on the server side (this could be the reason to use Ruby on Rails).
- A bad thing is you need to scroll subtitle while watching. So I'm thinking how to automatically scroll it in a convenient way (but, maybe it seems like impossible to implement).

## Credits

I must give credits to these two amazing websites.

## License

I don't know much about License. Probably, I even already broke some copyright things.
