# Random Number Generator

This is deployed using github.io. Click [here](http://hi-ogawa.github.io/randomNumberGenerator/).
It looks very silly, but if you have Mac PC, which include an automatic speaking function,
you can use this to practice number recognition by listening.

## How it works

TODO: I will give some pictures or videos to show how it could be used.

## Futue functions or fixes

- Sometimes, I'm confused by two number, 8 (eitht) and 9 (nine). So it would be interesting
  to implement some function which generates numbers including certain numbers with higher probability.
- Record what number gets a wrong answer to review the trend of your misses.
